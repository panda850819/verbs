# Conditional Review Passes (Pass 4-7)

Run a pass ONLY when its scope signal fired in Step 4 (`SCOPE_*`). Findings use the same `[P0-P3] (confidence: N/10) file:line` format as the always-on passes and merge into the same Step 5 pool.

**Pass 4 — Migration Safety** (only if SCOPE_MIGRATION):
- Backwards-incompatible schema changes without migration path
- Missing rollback strategy (no down migration)
- Data loss risk (column drops, type changes on populated tables)
- Lock duration on large tables (ALTER on millions of rows)

**Pass 5 — API Contract** (only if SCOPE_API):
- Breaking changes to existing endpoints (removed fields, changed types)
- Missing versioning for breaking changes
- Inconsistent error response format
- Missing or wrong HTTP status codes

**Pass 6 — Auth/Permissions** (only if SCOPE_AUTH):
- Privilege escalation paths (user can access admin resources)
- Missing auth checks on new endpoints
- Token/session handling flaws (no expiry, no rotation)
- Secrets logged or exposed in error messages

**Pass 7 — Infra/CI** (only if SCOPE_INFRA):
- Secrets hardcoded in config files
- Missing environment variable validation
- Docker image using latest tag instead of pinned version
- CI steps that can silently fail
