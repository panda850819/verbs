# Dispatch (process axis)

Before responding to any task-shaped message, match it against this table. On match: announce the match, then invoke the skill (runtime with a Skill tool) or follow its SKILL.md inline (runtime without). Matched-but-unavailable: say so; never silently skip.

| Signal | Invoke |
|---|---|
| Fuzzy idea / scope not locked / 想討論 | `grill` (atomic drill; use `grill --brief` for structured brief) |
| Prepared plan, want independent multi-angle critique | `advisor --panel` (blind cross-model critics) |
| Load-bearing judgment / design fork / decision expensive-if-wrong, want a second opinion | `advisor` (pull a decorrelated cross-model take) |
| Touching prod, shared infra, or harness paths (`~/.agents`, `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`) | `careful` first |
| Bug fix / feature / refactor (3+ files or new abstraction) | grill-lite plan first, not direct edits |
| Mechanical, file-scoped build units with locked spec | delegate — `handover` (Codex) or subagent; main model orchestrates |
| Error / crash / regression / failing test / "used to work and now doesn't" | `debug` (root cause before any fix) |
| Build / fix a UI surface, "looks off", 不好看 / 很醜 / 排版 / 字體 | `ui` (lock direction, fight defaults) |
| Focused build-to-ship session | `sprint` |
| About to commit | `review`, then `ship` |
| Knowledge note or decision closed | `ship knowledge <path>` |
| External artifact before install / adopt | `gatekeeper` |
| Run a bounded coding loop (test/build/CI until green) | hardened kickoff in `docs/loop-kickoffs.md` |
| Non-trivial but no row matches | classify the load-bearing unknown: fact→inspect first (code/docs/knowledge base) · intent→`grill` · taste→`ui` · architecture→`grill --brief` · risk→`careful` · verification→`debug` · mechanical→`handover`; still unclear → pandastack `RESOLVER.md`, pick closest |

Miss log: 事後發現該用而沒用 → append `date | runtime | signal | skill` to `~/.agents/memory/dispatch-miss.log`. Invocations are appended automatically by the plugin's PreToolUse hook to `~/.agents/memory/dispatch-fired.log`. Both logs are reviewed periodically (e.g. at a weekly retro).

<!-- Maintenance: this file is the SINGLE SOURCE for the process-axis routing table.
     Injected at session start by hooks/session-start (Claude Code + Codex both run
     plugin hooks). Hosts without plugin hooks read this file directly.
     ~/.agents/AGENTS.md § Dispatch Protocol is a pointer here — do not fork the table.
     Keep this file compact: it lands in every session's context. -->
